# relayALU
A complete functional Arithmetic Logic Unit using relays and designed on Proteus

This project describes an ALU made only with electromechanical relays, is partly inspired by [Zuze Z3 computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)), [Harry Porter's Relay Computer](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/index.html) and many others, contact me if you want my full paper.
